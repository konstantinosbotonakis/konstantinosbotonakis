# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!


I'm Konstantinos, a Senior Staff Software Engineer with a focus on PHP / GoLang and Javascript. I'm passionate about building robust and scalable web applications and platforms.

On GitHub, you'll find projects that showcase some of my skills in both front-end and back-end development and of course some public contributions. 

Feel free to take a look at my repositories. If you have any questions or if there's an opportunity to work together, don't hesitate to reach out.

Joke of the year: "Why did a PHP developer break up with his date? Because she had no echo.".
