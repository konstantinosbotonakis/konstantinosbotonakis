# Hi there ðŸ‘‹!


I am Konstantinos, a Principal Engineer specialising in PHP, Go, and JavaScript, with a proven track record of delivering scalable, high-performance platforms. My expertise spans system architecture, performance optimisation, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver complex projects at scale.

On GitHub, you will find examples of my open-source work, technical experiments, and contributions that reflect my approach to building maintainable, resilient systems. My work often bridges front-end and back-end domains, with an emphasis on clean architecture, automation, and operational excellence.

I am always open to discussing high-impact projects, platform modernisation initiatives, and opportunities where technical strategy meets business growth.
